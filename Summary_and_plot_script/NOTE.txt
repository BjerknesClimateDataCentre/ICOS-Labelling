To Remember when create instrument in quincamilla:
- licor 6262 does internal calculation from wet to dry -> quincamilla does not
need the H2o (set 'completely dry box' to 'yes')
- licor7000 does NOT do internal calculation from wet to dry -> quincamilla needs
the h2o (set 'completely dry box' to 'no')



Before run the scripts:
- remove the messages from the external data which are not core parameter from that station type (e.g. remove salinity messages from VOS stations).
- since we might remove all messages from some rows do the following replacement: replace ",4,"","  with  ",2,"",".
  This makes sure the QC flag is 2 when no messages occur
- The '2' in CO2 from the header is gone. Add this so that R does not complain
